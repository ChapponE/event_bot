Introduction
------------
This post introduces my first Discord bot designed to remind users of upcoming events throughout the week while automatically updating the weekly message.

------------
How to use
------------
After pulling the GitHub project, you need to create a '.env' file at the root of your bot folder. This file must include the following three variables: DISCORD_API_TOKEN, channel_id, and guild_id. You can find the DISCORD_API_TOKEN in your application bot settings, while the channel_id and guild_id can be obtained from your Discord guild and channel settings, respectively. Ensure to select the channel_id of the desired channel where you want the bot to send messages every week.
